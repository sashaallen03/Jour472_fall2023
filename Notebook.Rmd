This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(readr)
homicide_data <- read_csv("data/homicide_data.csv") 

homicide_data <- homicide_data |>
  mutate(reported_date = ymd(reported_date))

View(homicide_data)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

**\"As Baltimore has seen a stunning surge of violence, with nearly a killing each day for the past three years in a city of 600,000, homicide arrests have plummeted."**

```{r}
bmore_homicide_data |>
  mutate(reported_date =ymd(reported_date)) |>
  mutate(year = year(reported_date)) |>
  filter(str_detect(city, 'Baltimore')) |>
  filter(year == '2017' | year == '2016' | year == '2015') |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    average_per_day = (count/365)
  )
```
