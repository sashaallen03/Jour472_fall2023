Question: How has the amount of grants and loans handed out changed over time? (Since we have data since FY2009)

Findings: We found that 2020 was the year that the most grants and loans were distributed, and where the most money was spent. This could be due to a surplus in government spending during the pandemic, because so many things were shut down.

Limitations: could not filter by department because of varying department names

```{r}
number_loans_overtime <- loans_data |>
  group_by(Fiscal.Year)|>
  summarize(Number_Given = n())

amount_loans_over_time <- loans_data |>
  group_by(Fiscal.Year)|>
  summarize(Yearly_Sum = sum(Amount)) |>
  arrange(Yearly_Sum)

number_and_amount <- number_loans_overtime |>
  left_join(amount_loans_over_time, by = "Fiscal.Year")

```

Question: What zip codes or counties receive the most grants from the state of Maryland and why?

Limitations: Zipcodes include 6 and 9 digit codes

```{r}
zipcode_organization <- loans_data |>
  group_by(Zip.Code)|>
  summarize(Zip_Sum = sum(Amount)) |>
  arrange(desc(Zip_Sum))
```

```{r}
zipcode_num_amount <- number_and_amount |>
  
  median_age <- get_acs(geography = "county")
  
```
