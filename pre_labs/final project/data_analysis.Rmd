library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
loans_data <- read.csv ("data/md_loan_data.csv")
 
Moore = col_double()
clean_names
```

Question: How has the amount of grants and loans handed out changed over time? (Since we have data since FY2009)?

```{r}
number_loans_over_time <- loans_data |>
  group_by(Fiscal.Year)|>
  summarize(Number_of_Loans_Grants_Given = n())
```

```{r}
number_loans_over_time_money <- loans_data|>
  group_by(Amount)|>
  sum(Amount(n))|>
  group_by(Fiscal.Year)
  
```
